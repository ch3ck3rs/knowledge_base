# Using git


If you are not a fan of the git bash command style interface, PyCharm will do just about all of it for you.

**The basics of git are:** pull > add > commit > push

- Repository (or repo) 
    - this is what sits on github.com
    - it holds all the master files and is like the back up
- pull (a fresh copy of the repo if changes were made by someone else)
- add (file(s) that you want to track)
- commit (changes, this creates a refresh point)
- push (changes back to the repo so others can see them)
- **_until you commit and push_** no changes can be seen by others

## Starting a new Repo ##
To start working with an existing repo on a new machine (or in a new directory) you should clone the repo

		git clone <repo> <directory path>

Cloning the repo will bring down all the existing docs and branches and will set you on the current HEAD of the default branch.

#### git branching
You can create a new branch of the project, play around with it, pull in updates from the master branch, make commits 
and push to the repo without affecting the main program (like a sandbox).  When you get the new feature working on your 
branch, it can then be merged back into the master.

Notes

- you must add a file every time you make a change to it
    - or just wait til you want to commit, then pull > add --all > commit > push 
- git status (in the terminal will show you which files are ready to be committed, which are being tracked but will
    not be committed right now, and those which are not tracked)
- PyCharm > Version Control > Default Change list will also tell you this
    - **green** - edited since last commit and ready for next commit (git add was done since your last edit)
    - **blue** - edited since last commit but will not be committed (you have made a change since the last git add)
    - **red** - not being tracked, have never done git add
    - **white** - tracked but no edits since last commit
