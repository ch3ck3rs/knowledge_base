# The nbconvert library is installed native in Jupyter

This lib give you api like access to convert batches of notebooks, export
figures or code blocks.

[see example in the docs](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbconvert_library.html)

This [stack overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33159518/collapse-cell-in-jupyter-notebook)
has suggested install steps and additional packages.  Install the package on your main kernel
(not in venv, unless you specifically run the notebook out of there).  After restarting, on the main
tree page you should see an additional 'nbconvert' tab where you can enable select features.
