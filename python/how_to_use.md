# How to use this knowledge base

Base URL = https://ch3ck3rs.github.io/knowledge_base

to navigate to a page use the standard pattern below

		Base_URL/folder/sub-folder/page.html

each folder must have an index or readme file, this is what the open filepath will look for. i.e.

	Base_URL/folder

will look for the following file 

	Base_URL/folder/index.html

### YOU DO NOT NEED TO CONVERT TO HTML ###

jeckyll will auto convert your .md to a .html when the page is called.  This means when the 

	# Browswer calls for 
	Base_URL/folder/index.html

	# it is actually looking for
	Base_URL/folder/index.md


### Templates ###

There should be a basic index template and a basic info template that you can start with, or copy the content from an info file in the folder you are working in.
