# 2020 Professional Goals - [ohallaatme](https://github.com/ohallaatme)

## I. General Themes

**1. Seeing Projects to Completion** - Have had a tendancy to jump from topic to topic and play with various coding languages but flop so quickly I have struggled to build a professional coding portfolio or useful personal tools. Completing Java course (Basics and Web) in Q4 2019 was a helpful start in turning this around. This goes hand in hand with blogging goal. Taking time especially in Q1 to really hone in on interests that are fun *and* beneficial to invest in. Interests logged in section **II - Interests to Invest In**.

**2. Blogging** - Hand in hand with 1, develop my own webiste and blog with Medium based on main interests to develop professional presence and connections online.

## II. Interests to Potentially Invest In
**1. Python and Related Libraries** - **Committed**

**2. C#** - Beneficial for potentially developing on Microsoft platforms, resources already purchased from 2018 interest
  * Game Deveopment with Unity - Goes with idea to have a self dev game hosting website
  * Web/Azure cloud development, could be helpful for career at current job

**3.App Development** - Still would hold benefit at current position and would open doors to develop business ideas


## III. By Month

### January

##### Goals/Results
** 1. Complete Virtual Pet Tamogotchi Project Code Development with Arcade Library**
  * Status on 1/31/2020 - *Complete*
  * Project Link - [Virtual Pet](https://github.com/ohallaatme/VirtualPet)

** 2. Complete Blog Portion of Django Course to Have Blog Template to Go Off of**
- Course Link - [Django 2.2 & Python | The Ultimate Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-django-django-2-python-web-dev-website/learn/lecture/9517126?start=840#overview)
  * Status on 1/31/2020 - *Complete*
  * Project Link - [Portfolio](https://github.com/ohallaatme/Portfolio)

** 3. Complete and Commit Three Algorithmic Coding Challenges**
  * Status on 1/31/2020 - *Incomplete - Half Met*
    - Detail on why incomplete - Need to decide whether or not future role would require technical interview. Doing incremental code challenges is inefficient due to knowledge loss, also felt spread to thin between topics with goals.
  * Project link - [Python-BrainTeasers](https://github.com/ohallaatme/Python-BrainTeasers/tree/master/venv)

##### Summary/Key Takeaways
1. **Incremental code challenges is inefficient** -  need to either commit to it as a primary goal if required for technical roles in the future or not do it at all and focus on completing projects.
   * **For now** - Focus on content building/career in February. Decide if this is a later goal if required in March/April

2. **Having a couple of goals to chip at is helpful in avoiding getting sick of one project, however goals this month were too diversified** - This month's goals included a web app, a video game on a desktop and algorithmic exercises not related to an end development project. Additionally, a lot of work at job included desktop development. Do the following for efficiency:
   1. Still shoot to complete 2/3 primary goals but aim to have them more related.
   2. Consider type of development at work and angle goals to relate to this if possible so progress completed towards skill development at work can help personal goals timing-wise.

### February
##### Goals/Results
** 1. Complete GitHub Commits with Polished README files and Blog Content ready for publishing for the following:**

  * VirtualPet Project from January
  * Kivy Desktop App to Store Data Science Scripts for Non-Data Science People
  * Benford's Script for Catching Fraud - *Use Kaggle Set for data*

** 2. Dig into PyInstaller and Give Best Faith Effort to Package Kivy GUI Application**

  * Completion marked by solid time spent and reaching out to GitHub/Stack Overflow/ Potentially Talk Python to Me group for solution
    - This is a challenging area for Python so may not be able to entirely solve

** 3. Learn How to Write Unit Tests in Python and Write Tests For all Three Projects for Goal #1 and Include in README**
