##### Goals/Results

**Finish HI Series** - Seek to have the HI series set up in SAP and orderable.  
**Result** Not complete.  Main causes (1) High level part numbers (i.e. 011-HIS726SS.88) were set up with hypen and not hyphen minus, so we have to start over on part set up. (2) Procurement still has not sourced the parts we are missing.  
**What's Next?**  Ken is resetting up the corrected part numbers, so I will need to re-create BOMs, recipes and dwg packages.  I will need to stay on top of procurement to get parts sourced.
