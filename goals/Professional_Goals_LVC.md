# 2020 Goals - [ch3ck3rs](https://github.com/ch3ck3rs)

## I. General Themes

**Industry Awareness** - Pull my head out of the weeds and get an idea of the bigger picture.  Read journal articles, new trends, invest in history.  Areas include Data Science, Water Science and Customer needs. 

**Systems Knowledge** - Python, Linux, Postgres - The future is Digital, not only Ecolab but globally.  Being able to translate business needs into technical solutions will be critical to success.  
* Learn enough linux to understand the backbone.  Maybe some SSH tunneling, or set up a basic server and run a website on it. 
* Gain a broader understanding of the Python Libraries and do some basic tutorials.  Read blogs and journals about their applications.  This is more about the research than the outcome.
* Learn enough PostgreSql to be a basic DBA for home grown website.  Give out roles, change the fields and structure after data import.  Do NOT try to be a genius, but hit a few speed bumps. 

**Journaling** - be reflective on all the changes and new challenges that are arising from start a masters, moving to a new state and working from home.  The goal is to not clam up, not necessarily for public consumption. 

## II. Interests to Potentially Invest In

* Knitting & Quilting
* Additional Languages C#, .NET or MonkeyC (Garmin)

## III. By Month

### Februrary

##### Goals/Results

**Push on Standard Inventory** - Seek to have the standard inventory for the USP and the RO line completed by the end of Feb.  This includes all dwgs, boms and cost rolls. <span class="text-orange">**Result**</span> USP prodcut line was completed! RO product line is nearly completed. Minor modifications to the mechanical dwgs are under way.  The boms have been updated in SAP, however this was completed too late in the cost roll cycle and will need to be executed manually. **What is next?**

**Do well in School** - Stay on top of work.  **Results** I have kept up with all assignments easily and should consider taking on the additional work in the recommended section

**Outline Django Goals App** - Complete the Goals App and host on Digital Ocean.  **Result**The App is functional and outline of flow and next steps has been made in the Life project goal page.  The project has not yet been hosted on Digital Ocean.

##### Summary/Key Takeaways

I did not accomplish as much as I would have like in Feb.  I spent a lot of time idly listening to fun audio books instead of investing in knitting projects or in the Django app.  This lack of sustained focus is cyclical.  I am not sure if it is because I have too much on my plate or not enough.  I should start breaking things down into smaller chunks that can be accomplished in a evening to keep the motivation up. Quick wins sound silly, but they work!

### March

##### Goals/Results

**What is next on the Standard Product Line**  Determine the next stage of the standardization project.  **Result** Who freaking knows.  My next goal is to get the RO Kits outlined and into SAP.  The group is now moving on to work on the HI Series. 

**Industry Awareness** - read one article or Situation Awareness Report per week  **Result**  I was not able to get to any more SARs while still in Naperville.   I have started to read articles / listen to dily marketplace podcasts to stay in touch with trends. 

**Do Extra in School** - It is half way through the semester.  Start doing the extra assignments each week and take note of the additional resources.  My Current skill level is above the average, but I should not slack off.  Take advantage of time with the professor!  **Result** Did a little extra school wise.  Most of the extra work was put toward the Ecolab/UMN Covid Collaboration and in working through the SciKit-Learn Tutorials. 

**Finish Beanies** - Get them done before winter is over!  **Result** Due to covid-19 the PyCon Beanie because less of a priority.  I finished half of Katie's and then started working on my Father's beanie. Over all made good progress. 

##### Summary/Key Takeaways

March was CRAZY!  Covid-19 had everyone working from home unexpectedly and it took a while to adjust.  The first week was more house work than actual work, but that is ok.  I finally settled into a routine of emails for 30 min after breakfast, 45 min of learning, 45 min of task that I don't want to do, then the what ever else is on my todo list.  The last 15 min of the day are used to plan out the next day.  On Friday, it is 30-40 min to close out the week and set up the next. 

### April 

#### Goals/Results

**Standard Product Line** - Have RO kits complete and all drawings in the system.

**Coding**

- Scikit-Learn - complete [text analysis Exercises 1 & 2](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html) and then start to apply to the PTS parts catalog.  This month, the goal is to have the catalog training data defined. 
- edX MIT 6.00.2X - stay current on all work

**Ecolab & UMN Collaboration** It looks like I will be a team lead.  Stay current and reasses once teams are assigned. 

**Knitting**  Spend at least 2 hours per week knitting.
