# 2020 Goals - [ch3ck3rs](https://github.com/ch3ck3rs)

## I. General Themes

**Industry Awareness** - Pull my head out of the weeds and get an idea of the bigger picture.  Read journal articles, new trends, invest in history.  Areas include Data Science, Water Science and Customer needs. 

**Systems Knowledge** - Python, Linux, Postgres - The future is Digital, not only Ecolab but globally.  Being able to translate business needs into technical solutions will be critical to success.  
* Learn enough linux to understand the backbone.  Maybe some SSH tunneling, or set up a basic server and run a website on it. 
* Gain a broader understanding of the Python Libraries and do some basic tutorials.  Read blogs and journals about their applications.  This is more about the research than the outcome.
* Learn enough PostgreSql to be a basic DBA for home grown website.  Give out roles, change the fields and structure after data import.  Do NOT try to be a genius, but hit a few speed bumps. 

**Journaling** - be reflective on all the changes and new challenges that are arising from start a masters, moving to a new state and working from home.  The goal is to not clam up, not necessarily for public consumption. 

## II. Interests to Potentially Invest In

* Knitting & Quilting
* Additional Languages C#, .NET or MonkeyC (Garmin)

## III. By Month

### Februrary

##### Goals/Results

**Push on Standard Inventory** - Seek to have the standard inventory for the USP and the RO line completed by the end of Feb.  This includes all dwgs, boms and cost rolls.   **Result** USP prodcut line was completed! RO product line is nearly completed. Minor modifications to the mechanical dwgs are under way.  The boms have been updated in SAP, however this was completed too late in the cost roll cycle and will need to be executed manually. **What is next?**

**Do well in School** - Stay on top of work.  **Results** I have kept up with all assignments easily and should consider taking on the additional work in the recommended section

**Outline Django Goals App** - Complete the Goals App and host on Digital Ocean.  **Result**The App is functional and outline of flow and next steps has been made in the Life project goal page.  The project has not yet been hosted on Digital Ocean.

##### Summary/Key Takeaways

I did not accomplish as much as I would have like in Feb.  I spent a lot of time idly listening to fun audio books instead of investing in knitting projects or in the Django app.  This lack of sustained focus is cyclical.  I am not sure if it is because I have too much on my plate or not enough.  I should start breaking things down into smaller chunks that can be accomplished in a evening to keep the motivation up. Quick wins sound silly, but they work!

### March

##### Goals/Results

**What is next on the Standard Product Line**

**Industry Awareness** - read one article or Situation report per week

**Do Extra in School** - It is half way through the semester.  Start doing the extra assignments each week and take note of the additional resources.  My Current skill level is above the average, but I should not slack off.  Take advantage of time with the professor!

**Finish Beanies** - Get them done before winter is over!
